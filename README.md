This is a practice segment
One day there was a kid.
His parents left him home alone.
It was late that night when the kid heard guys trying to break into his house.
The kid knew he had to defend the house so he placed traps all around the house.
He defended the house through the night and stayed safe while he was doing it.
Everything was safe and sound until he heard glasses breaks in the back of his house. He thought for a second and he realized it was the bathroom window next to his parents room.
